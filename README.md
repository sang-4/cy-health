##Description

I'm developing CyHealth, a suitable  dashboard for a management system that can serve a wide range of organisations/institutions. This app displaya COVID-19 statistics since 2020 and more updates as the API gets updated. This app is still under development and will be constantly updated. You can filter/search the continets, countries and infections by their respective names. I look forwrd to having a mobile application of the same as soon as I am done with this. You can bookmark this page and be sure to check back later for my recent updates.
